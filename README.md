# Tiny series
These small little programs were attempts to bring Win32 programs into MenuetOS world. But before the programs were finished, MenuetOS went into X86_64 and closed sources. Around the same time, I lost interest for Win32 programming and started to focus on web development almost exclusively.

However, assembly programming for Windows is amazing. We produced fully functioning programs in only a few kilobytes. All resources compiled from fasm macros. There was a feeling of absolute control.

Most of the code was inspired by Ketil Olsen's programs. Here there are sources by several authors, all credited in their respective files. All of them were open source files shared on different websites with a permissive license similar to teh MIT License.

## tinyedit
Smallest useful (reasonable featured) text editor with syntax highligting.

## tinycad
A very restricted set of features for a CAD but with a promising interface that permitted expansion.

## tinypad
A new concept of application, where each set of features were provided in a dll and loaded when needed.

## tinyweb
A very primitive web browser. There is just a fast html parser and an assorted set of renderers. It's interesting as a project, but at the time, the web stack of MenuetOS was still under construction.
